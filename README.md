# Mnthunzi Wathu Foundation
Welcome to the Mnthunzi Wathu Foundation's official GitHub repository!

Our foundation is dedicated to improving the lives of people in Malawi by developing a platform where citizens and outside donors can donate towards projects handpicked by the communities. We also aim to create a member area where people can report problems they face in their area and enable decision-makers to select projects to be funded and implemented.
